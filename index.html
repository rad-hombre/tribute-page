      <h2 id="title">Marcus Aurelius Antoninus (121 - 180 CE)</h2>
      <p class="">
      Marcus Aurelius was a Roman Emperor who ruled from 161 CE to 180 CE. He ruled as co-emporer with Lucius
      Verus from 161 CE until Verus's death in 169 CE.

          <p>
Known as the last of the Five Good Emperors, Marcus Aurelius is today considered one of the most
              important Stoic philosophers.
          </p>

          <p>
Marcus Aurelius's work Meditations (written in Greek while on campaign between
              170 CE and 180 CE) is still revered today.       </p>

          <p>
              The work serves as an example of how Aurelius
              approached the Platonic ideal of a philosopherâ€“king, and how he symbolized much
              of what was best about Roman civilization.
          </p>

      <p>At the start of his reign, the Empire, under the joint
      rule of Marcus and Lucius Verus, defeated a revitalized Parthian Empire in
      a war from 161 to 166. </p>

       <p>
The unforeseen consequences for the Empire were great. The returning troops
brought with them a plague (the so-called Antonine Plague), which may have been smallpox. It would eventually kill about 5 million people, and severely weaken the Empire. </p>
<p >
Aurelius fought the German tribes during a long war from 166 CE to 180 CE. The
pressure from the Goths moving west pushed settled Germanic tribes into invading
Roman client states in Gaul, and across the Danube. </p>
