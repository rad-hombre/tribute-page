      <h2>Marcus Aurelius Antoninus (121 - 180 CE)</h2>
      <p>
      <p class="lead">
      Marcus Aurelius was a Roman Emperor from 161 to 180. He ruled with Lucius Verus as co-emperor from 161 until Verus' death in 169.

He was the last of the Five Good Emperors, and is considered one of the most important Stoic philosophers.

Marcus Aurelius' work Meditations, written in Greek while on campaign between 170 and 180, is still revered. It serves as an example of how Aurelius approached the Platonic ideal of a philosopherâ€“king, and how he symbolized much of what was best about Roman civilization.

       <footnote class="lead">â€“ Marcus Aurelius</footnote>

      </blockquote> 
      <p class="lead">At the start of his reign, the Empire, under the joint rule of Marcus and Lucius Verus, defeated a revitalized Parthian Empire in a war from 161 to 166. </p>
        
       <p class="lead"> 
The unforeseen consequences for the Empire were great. The returning troops brought with them a plague (the so-called Antonine Plague), which may have been smallpox. It would eventually kill about 5 million people, and severely weaken the Empire. </p>
<p class="lead">
Aurelius fought the German tribes during a long war from 166 to 180. The pressure from the Goths moving west pushed settled Germanic tribes into invading Roman client states in Gaul, and across the Danube. </p>
